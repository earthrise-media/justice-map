# Justice40

Justice40 EJScreen prototype application.

- This is a Next.js, styled with Tailwind, using Mapbox GL for most of the magic.
- It's currently deployed to GitHub Pages, so none of the Next.js fancy stuff is usable.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
